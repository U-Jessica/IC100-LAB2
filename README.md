I have merged all the sums into one repository 

1. Write a program to tell whether a given 3-digit number is an Armstrong number (sum of each digit raised to the power 3 is equal to the number) or not. Also, give a proper error message if the number given as input is not a 3-digit number. 

2. A company insures its drivers in the following cases: 
- If the driver is unmarried. 
- If the driver is married, above 45 years of age and has at least two children. - If the driver is married, above 35 years of age and has at least one child. 
In all the other cases, the driver is not insured. 
If the marital status, age and number of children of the driver are the inputs, Write a program to determine whether the driver is insured or not. 

3. Write a program to check whether a given number is odd or even using bitwise operators. 
(Hint: What would be the least significant bit for even and odd numbers in a binary system.) 

4. Given a year as input, print if it is leap year or not.
